Architecture design plan:
	User enters a name and clicks `start game` button (DONE) /
	ROR generates a random 4x4 matrix, and its possible solutions.
	This will be stored in database, with an unique ID.
	The random matrix and the ID will be sent to the Client.
	The react will display the matrix, (Static value is displayed for now) /stage/index
	Client will have 2 minutes to find as much words as possible.
	The user will enter guess words and the words will be displayed in the side(not validated)
	Once time is up, The list is validated against the database table possible solutions.
	The resulsts will be displayed to the user on the Results page.
